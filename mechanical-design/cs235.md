# Bearings

* Constrains motion
* Reduce friction
* Consists of inner race, outer race and balls
* Problem: Inner race can be twisted; Solution: Use two bearings
* Problem: the shaft can move freely; Solution: Use shaft collar; If the shaft collar touches the outer race use spacers/ shim/ washer/ inner race spacer/ ball bearing shim
* Ball bearings have less friction, plain bearings are cheeper
* Can have flanches to keep it in place
* Use spring to preload the bearing
* Otherwise add a lip into the material
* Retaining ring just as good as flanched bearings but cheaper
* MDF: thick, repeatability, remains very flat 1/4'' in opposite to plywood
* slip fit: 2-4 thousands difference in diameter e.g inner race is 0.250'' then shafts needs to be 0.2500'' - 0.002'' (0,0508mm)
* Press fit: doesnt come out expect with a lot of force
* Slip fit: can move freely
* Interferance: In between press and slip
* Do not use a hammer
* shaft need to have a chamfer
* If shaft doesnt fit: skrewdriver, 400 grid sandpaper, wear googles, use water to cool

# Gears

* Transmission of motion torque
* Velocity: theta_dot_2 = d1 / d2 * theta_dot_1
* Torque: tau_2 = d2 / d1 * tau_1
* Spear gears have backlash
* Can bre reduced to two circles, d1 and d2
* threoretical pitch circle / diameter (PD): point of contact
* pitch is distance between teeth / distance along a curve not a straight distance
* Pitch is also called module in metric
* Always use gears of the same pitch
* Two types of teeth: Involute, cycloidal
* Two gears rigidly attached to each other is called compound gear, is used to have more torque
* Plastic gear is cheap but they break easiely
* Usually you dont build your compound gear yourself, you use a gear head
* Idler: changes direction of rotation or span gaps
* Spear gears: internal and external
* compound gear: two or more spear gears rigidly coupled
* Rack and pinion: Rack is a spear gear that is unwrapped, linear motion
* Rack and pinion spacing = PD/2
* Two spear gears spacing = (PD1 + PD2) / 2
* Mate rack and pinion inside fusion 360 with offset plane at top of rack and distance to pinion center = PD / 2 - PH
* Worm and wormgear; 
* Wormgear extremly compact for high gear reduction; a lot of energy loss because of sliding contact; lowest efficiency gear; not backdrivable means you cant use the output to move the input, another term is self locking; have one tooth
* backdrivability is good if power is down and you want to move a sushi robot with a knife back
* Worm are long and skinny and has a helix; left-handed and right-handed
* E = beta_1 + beta_2; E .. angle between the shaft; beta .. helix angles; typically 45°
* Example beta_1 = 45°; beta_2 = 45° means you can put the in 90° angle; take a left and right handed: 45° - 45° = 0°; those you can only put planar to each other
* Helical gear; can be monted in an angle; at high speed helical gears are less noisy; at low speed no difference
* bevel gear; perpendicular axis; doesnt have to be 1:1; doesnt have to be 90°
* miter gear; are a subset of bevel gears; special form of bevel; always 1:1 ratio; always 90° to each other
* hearing bone gear; also called double helical; gets rid of axial force between two helical gears
* If you need high gear ratio in small space use worm gear; if you don't want the output move the input use worm; If you need offset use worm or helical gear otherwise use bevel gear
* Gear efficiency: Spear: 98-99; helical: 98-99 if parallel; double helical: 98-99; bevel 98-99; worm 20-98; cross helical: 70-98;
* Perpendicular, orthogonal, skew, cross helical is same term for helical in 90° configuration

# Gear head

* Spear gearhead; don't make your own buy them; first gear can be plastic to save money
* Planetary gearhead; planet gear; sun gear (the one in the middle); epicyclic gearing: axis of the gears are moving; extreme power density; much more expensive because more parts and higher tolerances
* Harmonic gearhead; used in asimo robot
* Gear Ration N; friction on the input; will be multiplied by N and inertia will be N²; the higher the gear ration the less back driveable
* delrin good gears; expensive
* acetal bad gears
* Mount gear: hub; hub diameter; bore; press-fit; clamp; set-screw (flat and set-screw); keyed;
* Set-screw: pain in the ass; use thread locker to prevent set-screw from vibrating free; don't use without a flat
* Clamp: are good; dont need shaft preperation; easy to install; don't vibrate free
* Keys
* Press-fit is difficult to get it back off
* Recommendation: Prefer clamp; maybe set-screw

# Screws

* Apply axial force between two bodies
* Torx, take higher torque
* Sizes: M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M8
* Strip: 10 8 4 0 0
* Don't use M1.6 it sucks
* M2 strips very easy, means makes your hex to a circle
* M3 is also easy to strip
* M4 don't strip easiely
* Socket: hex, torx
* Head: flat or with angle
* Partially / fully threaded
* Outside diameter M2 .. 2 mm; M3 .. 3 mm
* Pitch M3 x 0.5 mm; M4 x 0.7 mm; M5 x 0.8 mm; M6 x 1mm; M8 x 1.25mm
* Pitch = Linear distance it takes one thread to make one revolution
* First 3 - 4 threads of skrew take most of the load
* Tap Drill Size: M2 .. 1.6 mm; M3 2.5 mmm; M4 .. 3.3mm; M5 .. 4.2mm; M6 .. 5mm
* Only power tap M4 and bigger; M2, M3 can only be handtaped
* Clearance holes diameter: M2 .. 2.6; M3 .. 3.6; M4 .. 4.8mm; M5 .. 5.8; M6 .. 7.0
* Never tap both plates

# Dowl Pins

* Align two bodies
* Go into dowl holes
* In aluminum and steel dont use more then two or you overconstrain
* In soft materials like plastic or plywood using more then two will help
* For lazer cutted stuff: 3 dowl pins and 3 screws; sometimes also 4 and 4; on Bolt Circle (BC)

# Motors

* DC Motors brushed; most common motors; really fast; use gearhead to reduce speed and increase torque
* DC Motor brushless; RC planes; super hight torque density; needs tricky special electronics; wicked fast
* AC Motors; never use AC
* Steppers; feedforward; ticks as long you don't put too much load onto it; NEMA standard means you can plug and play; position control only
* Servos: DC brushed motor; with potentiometer and gearhead
* [Ultrasonic](https://pcbmotor.com); very slow
* V = Kv * omega (or theta dot)
* V = Back EMF or voltage you apply
* Kv .. konstant
* omega = rads / s
* Mounting Motor: A) Clamp; grab the motor on the outer casing; dont do it on plastic motors; don't overtight it
* B) fix it on the Bold pattern if there is some
* C) If the motor shaft is off center dont use A) 
* Can have backshaft for encoder; expensive motors usually have one
* Radial force on shaft; axial force on shaft; see datasheet; means: dont yank too hard; dont push too hard; 
* Spear gears can be much stronger in terms of radial force then planetary gears
* To get rid of backlash use anti backlash / preloaded gear: Problem increased friction; cost; complexity;
