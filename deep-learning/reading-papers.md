# Read Research Paper

5 - 20 paper = basic understanding / good enough
50 - 100 paper = good understanding

## Reading papers

1. Compile list of papers (medium/blog posts/arxiv)
2. Skip around list
    * Read 10% of a list, throw away papers that don't make sense, read the good ones, read the papers referenced by the good papers

## Reading one paper

1. Title / Abstract / Figures
2. Intro / Conclusion / Figures / skim rest / (skip related work)
3. Read but skip / skim math
4. Read the whole thing but skip parts that don't make sense

Try to answer this questions:
* What did the authors try to accomplish?
* What are the key elements of the approach?
* What can you use yourself?
* What other references do you want to follow?

## Sources of papers

* Twitter
* ML Subreddit
* NIPS / ICML / ICLR
* Friends

## Undestanding Math

* Rederive from scratch
* Download and run open-source code
* Reimplement code from scratch

## Tips

* Do steady reading not short burts
